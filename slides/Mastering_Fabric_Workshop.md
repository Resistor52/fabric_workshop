## Workshop Outline

### 1. Introduction to Fabric (10 minutes)

- Fabric is an open-source framework designed to make it easier to harness the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the command line. Developed with simplicity and versatility in mind, Fabric enables users to run patterns—predefined or custom scripts—that leverage LLMs for tasks like summarization, translation, or data analysis. By integrating seamlessly with CLI environments, Fabric empowers developers and security professionals to automate complex workflows, enhance productivity, and explore innovative use cases. The project's focus on modularity and ease of use ensures that both beginners and advanced users can quickly adopt it in their workflows.
- Fabric revolutionizes workflows for developers and security professionals by bridging the gap between the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the efficiency of the command line. By offering a framework that allows users to leverage LLMs for tasks like summarization, content generation, or data extraction, Fabric enables unparalleled productivity. For developers, it simplifies complex coding tasks, accelerates debugging, and integrates seamlessly with tools like Git and VS Code. For security professionals, Fabric provides automation for repetitive tasks, advanced capabilities for analyzing log files, and tools for generating actionable insights during incident response. This combination of functionality and adaptability makes Fabric an indispensable tool for enhancing efficiency and solving real-world challenges.
- Demonstrate practical security use cases to showcase Fabric's capabilities. For example, use Fabric to analyze a server log file for suspicious activity. This demo can include:
  - Analyzing email headers for potential phishing or spam indicators
  - Investigating AWS flow logs for suspicious network traffic
  - Examining packet captures for signs of DNS-based remote shell activity
  - Processing threat research articles to extract malware analysis insights

### 2. Why Use a Command Line Interface (5 minutes)

- Discussion on the power and flexibility of the CLI compared to GUIs:
  - Faster execution and lower resource consumption
  - Remote system access and management capabilities
  - Precise control over system operations
  - Easy automation through scripting
  - Consistent behavior across different platforms

- Advantages for automation, scripting, and efficiency in repetitive tasks:
  - Ability to chain multiple commands together using pipes
  - Create reusable scripts for common workflows
  - Schedule tasks and batch operations
  - Process large volumes of data efficiently
  - Integration with other tools and services

- Examples of how security professionals leverage CLI tools for analysis and automation:
  - Log parsing and analysis with tools like grep, awk, and sed
  - Network monitoring using tcpdump and netstat
  - System hardening through configuration management
  - Automated vulnerability scanning and reporting
  - Incident response and forensics data collection

### 3. Using Fabric with Visual Studio Code (10 minutes)
- Setting up Visual Studio Code for Fabric development and interaction.
- Extensions and tools to streamline Fabric workflows.
- Hands-on: Running a simple Fabric command in VS Code's integrated terminal.

### 4. Git, GitHub, and GitHub Codespaces Overview (10 minutes)
- Brief intro to Git and GitHub: version control and collaboration essentials.
- Exploring the https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric repository
- Explanation of GitHub Codespaces: What it is and why it's useful.
- Setting up a Codespaces environment for Fabric development.

### 5. Demo: Using Fabric in a Codespaces Container (10 minutes)
- Step-by-step demonstration of spinning up a Codespaces container.
- Running Fabric commands within the container.
- Advantages of Codespaces for collaborative Fabric development.

### 6. Understanding Fabric Patterns & Intro to Prompt Engineering (10 minutes)
- Explanation of Fabric patterns: What they are and how to use them effectively.
- Introductory concepts in prompt engineering for LLMs.
- Real-world examples of Fabric patterns solving complex tasks.

### 7. Getting Hands-on with Fabric: Cool Examples & Security Use Cases (20 minutes)
- Participants run Fabric patterns for themselves in a provided Codespace.
- Use cases explored:
  - Extracting claims from documents or transcripts.
  - Automating repetitive analysis workflows.
  - Security examples: Analyzing log files or generating incident response checklists.
- Discussion on how to customize patterns for specific needs.

### 8. Chaining Commands to Exploit CLI Power (10 minutes)
- Introduction to chaining commands with Fabric and native CLI tools.
- Examples:
  - Piping output for data analysis.
  - Combining Fabric with tools like grep, jq, and tee for advanced workflows.
- Hands-on activity: Building a simple chain of commands to process and analyze data.

### 9. Q&A and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)
- Addressing participants' questions.
- Sharing resources for further learning (e.g., links to Fabric documentation and GitHub repos).
- Encouraging participants to explore Fabric for their own workflows.
