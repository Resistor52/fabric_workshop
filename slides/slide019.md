# Understanding Temperature in LLMs

## What is Temperature?
- A parameter that controls response randomness
- Scale from 0.0 to 1.0
- Higher values = more creative/random
- Lower values = more focused/deterministic

## Temperature Guidelines
- 0.0: Best for factual responses, code analysis, security scanning, pattern matching
- 0.7: Good for creative writing, brainstorming, general conversation
- 1.0: Suitable for maximum creativity, story generation, exploring alternatives

Normally, you can just leave the default value (0.7)
