# Iterative Prompt Refinement

## The Refinement Process

- Start with a basic prompt and analyze the output quality
- Identify areas for improvement
- Adjust and test incrementally

## Example
```bash
# Initial attempt
echo "Check this log file: $(cat security_log.txt)" | fabric -p ai

# Refined version
echo "Analyze this log file for failed login attempts, highlighting IP addresses and timestamp patterns: $(cat security_log.txt)" | fabric -p ai
```
