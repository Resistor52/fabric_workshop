# Automation & Scripting Benefits

- **Command Chaining**
  ```bash
  # Example: Find large log files and analyze with Fabric
  find /var/log -size +10M | xargs fabric -p analyze_logs
  ```

- **Task Scheduling**
  ```bash
  # Example: Daily security scan
  0 0 * * * security_scan.sh | fabric -p summarize | mail -s "Daily Security Scan Report" soc@example.com
  ```

- **Batch Processing**
  ```bash
  # Example: Process multiple files
  for file in *.log; do
    fabric -p analyze_logs "$file" > "${file%.log}_report.md"
  done
  ```

- **Workflow Automation**
  ```bash
  # Example: Automated deployment pipeline
  git pull && make test && make deploy || send_alert "Deploy failed"
  ```
