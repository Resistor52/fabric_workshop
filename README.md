# Mastering Fabric Workshop

This repository contains materials for the "Mastering Fabric: Bring the Power of LLMs to the Command Line" workshop. The workshop provides hands-on experience with Fabric, an open-source framework that enables command-line interaction with Large Language Models.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop teaches participants how to:

- Understand and utilize Fabric for CLI-based LLM interactions
- Leverage Fabric with VS Code, Git/GitHub, and GitHub Codespaces
- Master prompt engineering through Fabric patterns
- Apply Fabric to real-world security use cases
- Chain commands for enhanced CLI workflows

For detailed objectives and outline, see the [full workshop syllabus](slides/Mastering_Fabric_Workshop.md).

## Environment Setup

### Recommended Environment

This workshop is designed to run on the [Fabric Learning Environment](https://github.com/Resistor52/fabric-course-vm), which comes pre-configured with:

- Fabric framework
- Ollama and the Mistral 7B model
- Required extensions
- Pattern directories
- Test data

### Alternative Setup

The workshop materials can be used in any environment with:

- Fabric installed
- Command-line interface
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Internet connection

NOTE: We are using Mistral so that students do not need to come to the workshop with API keys.
