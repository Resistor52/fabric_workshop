# Threat Intelligence Report: StealthViper Campaign
Date: 2024-03-15
Classification: TLP:AMBER
Report ID: TR-2024-0315-01

## Executive Summary
A sophisticated malware campaign dubbed "StealthViper" has been observed targeting financial institutions across Southeast Asia. The threat actor, tracked as FIN-087, employs a combination of social engineering and custom malware to compromise banking networks and initiate fraudulent transactions.

## Technical Details

### Initial Access Vector
The attackers primarily use spear-phishing emails containing malicious Excel documents. These documents exploit CVE-2023-38831 to execute malicious code. The emails are crafted to appear as financial reports from legitimate regional banks.

Example email subjects observed:
- Q4 2023 ASEAN Banking Sector Report
- Urgent: Inter-bank Transfer Verification Required
- Updated SWIFT Transaction Guidelines 2024

### Malware Characteristics
The StealthViper malware exhibits the following behaviors:

1. Initial Dropper (SHA256: 8f4b2d3a1c9e7f6b5d8a2c4e6f8d9a7b3c5e2d1f)
   - Written in Go
   - Uses custom XOR encryption
   - Establishes persistence via scheduled tasks
   - Masquerades as "WindowsUpdateService.exe"

2. Main Payload
   - Modular architecture
   - Command & Control over HTTPS (443)
   - DNS tunneling for data exfiltration
   - Anti-VM and anti-debugging capabilities

### C2 Infrastructure
Known Command & Control servers:
- update-service[.]asia-bank-secure[.]com
- swift-verify[.]banking-secure[.]net
- asean-banking[.]security-update[.]org

All domains were registered through NameCheap between December 2023 and January 2024.

## Observed TTPs
MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:
- T1566.001: Spear-phishing Attachment
- T1053.005: Scheduled Task
- T1571: Non-Standard Port
- T1572: Protocol Tunneling
- T1140: Deobfuscate/Decode Files
- T1027: Obfuscated Files or Information

## Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

### File Hashes (SHA256)
- 8f4b2d3a1c9e7f6b5d8a2c4e6f8d9a7b3c5e2d1f (Initial Dropper)
- 2a7b4c9d6e8f1a3b5c7d9e2f4a6b8c1d3e5f7a9 (Excel Document)
- 5e7a9c2b4f6d8e1a3c5b7d9f2e4a6b8c0d2f4a6 (Main Payload)

### Network Indicators
- TCP/443 beaconing to C2 domains
- DNS queries with encoded data in subdomain
- HTTPS POST requests containing encrypted data
- Unusual outbound SMB connections

## Recommendations

1. Network Defense:
   - Block known C2 domains
   - Monitor for suspicious DNS queries
   - Implement SSL inspection for encrypted traffic
   - Deploy network segmentation

2. Email Security:
   - Update email filtering rules
   - Block macro-enabled Office documents
   - Implement DMARC/DKIM/SPF

3. Endpoint Protection:
   - Update Windows systems to patch CVE-2023-38831
   - Monitor for suspicious scheduled tasks
   - Deploy EDR solutions
   - Enable PowerShell logging

## Attribution
Based on TTPs, infrastructure, and targeting, we assess with high confidence that FIN-087 is responsible for this campaign. This group has historically targeted financial institutions in Southeast Asia and demonstrates sophisticated malware development capabilities.

## Impact Assessment
- Severity: High
- Complexity: High
- Potential Impact: Critical

Financial institutions should treat this threat with high priority due to the sophisticated nature of the attack and the potential for significant financial losses.
