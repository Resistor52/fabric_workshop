# VPN Service Architecture
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: 2024-03-15

## System Overview
The VPN service provides secure remote access to internal corporate resources for employees and authorized contractors. The system uses OpenVPN for connection handling and implements multiple layers of security controls.

## Core Components

### Frontend Components
1. Load Balancer (HAProxy)
   - Distributes incoming VPN connections
   - Terminates TLS connections
   - Performs initial packet filtering
   - High availability configuration (Active-Active)

2. VPN Servers (OpenVPN)
   - Handles client authentication
   - Manages encrypted tunnels
   - Performs certificate validation
   - Logs connection attempts and sessions
   - Clustered deployment (3 nodes)

### Authentication Components
1. Certificate Authority (CA) Server
   - Issues client certificates
   - Manages certificate revocation
   - Offline root CA
   - Online intermediate CA

2. LDAP Integration
   - Active Directory authentication
   - Group policy enforcement
   - User account validation
   - Role-based access control

### Backend Components
1. Management Server
   - Configuration management
   - User provisioning
   - Certificate distribution
   - Monitoring and alerts

2. Log Analytics
   - Centralized logging (ELK Stack)
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Threat detection
   - Compliance reporting

### Security Components
1. Firewall System
   - Perimeter protection
   - Network segmentation
   - IDS/IPS integration
   - DDoS protection

2. Security Monitoring
   - SIEM integration
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Anomaly detection
   - Incident response automation

## Network Architecture

### Network Zones
1. DMZ (Public-facing)
   - Load balancers
   - VPN endpoints
   - DDoS protection

2. Authentication Zone
   - CA servers
   - LDAP servers
   - MFA services

3. Management Zone
   - Admin interfaces
   - Monitoring systems
   - Configuration management

4. Internal Network
   - Corporate resources
   - Internal applications
   - Data centers

## Data Flow

1. Initial Connection
   ```
   Client -> Load Balancer -> VPN Server -> Auth Server -> LDAP
   ```

2. Active Session
   ```
   Client <-> VPN Server <-> Internal Resources
   ```

3. Monitoring Flow
   ```
   VPN Server -> Log Analytics -> SIEM -> Security Team
   ```

## Security Controls

### Authentication
- Certificate-based authentication
- LDAP integration
- Multi-factor authentication
- Hardware security module (HSM) for key storage

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Network segmentation
- Just-in-time access
- Principle of least privilege

### Monitoring
- Real-time session monitoring
- Traffic analysis
- Behavioral analytics
- Compliance auditing

### Compliance
- SOC 2 Type II certified
- ISO 27001 compliant
- GDPR compliant
- HIPAA compliant

## Disaster Recovery
- Active-Active deployment
- Geographic redundancy
- Automated failover
- Regular backup testing

## Maintenance Procedures
- Regular security patches
- Certificate rotation
- Configuration backups
- Capacity planning

## Future Enhancements
1. Zero Trust Integration
2. Enhanced MFA Options
3. Cloud-native deployment
4. Automated compliance reporting
